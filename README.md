# tweeteroPOO-back

Tweetero is a simplified clone of Twitter, built with Node.js. This project aims to demonstrate how to refactor functional code to object-oriented 
programming (OOP) code.

## Installation

<h1>Clone the repository to your local machine.</h1>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesley-franca/tweeteroPOO-back.git
```

<h1>Install dependencies by running</h1>

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage
To use Tweetero, you will need to start the server by running 
```bash
npm start
```

<h2>Once the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to interact with the API.</h2>

Tweetero allows users to create an account, post tweets, get specific user tweets or all tweets.
<!-- 
The API endpoints for Tweetero are as follows:

##Doc

POST /sig-nup: Creates a new user account. 
POST /tweets: Creates a new tweet. 
GET /tweets: Retrieves all tweets. 
GET /tweets/username: Retrieves tweets from a specific user.
POST /users/:username/unfollow: Unfollows a user with the given username. Requires authentication.
To make requests to these endpoints, you can use an HTTP client library like axios.

<!-- ## Refactoring to OOP
The original code for Tweetero was written in a functional style, but has been refactored to OOP to demonstrate the benefits of OOP. The refactored code separates concerns into classes, follows the SOLID principles, and is easier to maintain and extend.

The following classes have been created:

App: The main class that initializes the application and sets up the server.
Database: A class that handles all database operations, such as saving and retrieving data.
User: A class that represents a user and handles user-related functionality, such as creating an account, logging in, and following and unfollowing other users.
Tweet: A class that represents a tweet and handles tweet-related functionality, such as creating a tweet and retrieving tweets for a user's feed.
By refactoring the code to OOP, we have achieved better separation of concerns and encapsulation, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
